We do not need sensors, wearables but <b> only the exisiting WiFi deployment </b> together with our ***AI Techniques, Signal Process Methods, Radar Techniques, 5G Communication Skills, Massive MIMO Knowledge, mmWave Studies...*** to make your life easier and convenient, <b> by your control of course </b>. Know more about [Wireless AI for wireless sensing and localization using ambient radio signals](https://www.originwirelessai.com/)...

## AI Techniques for Wireless Sensing <br/>
<b> 1. Device-free Wireless Monitoring System </b> [see more](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/publications/1Wireless-Monitor) <br/>
  * We created the first-of-its-kind device-free motion sensing system which was commercialized by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/) and won the [CES 2020 Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2020/Honorees/L/Linksys-Aware.aspx). In partnership with [Belkin](https://www.belkin.com/us/), it has been deployed over 150 countries worldwide as [LinkSysAware](https://www.linksys.com/us/linksys-aware/). <br/>


<b> 2. Wireless Vital Signs Detection System </b> [see more](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/publications/2Wireless-Vital-Sign)
  * We developed an accurate Sleep Monitoring System and commercialized it as Origin Health for Remote Patient Monitoring by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/), which won the [CES 2021 Best of Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2021/Best-Of/O/Origin-Health-Remote-Patient-Monitoring.aspx).

<b> 3. Wireless Driver Arrival Sensing for Smart Car </b> [see more](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/publications/3Wireless-Driver-Sensing)
  * We designed a Driver's Arrival Time Sensing System, which makes the car more smart in multiple-service management than the existing driver's presence sensing only system. Real-world tests show 92.5% accuracy with less than 1s error.

## mmWave Systems
<b> 4. mmWave-Based Vital Signs Monitoring </b> [see more](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/publications/4mmWave-Based-Vital-Sign)
  * We developed a Millimeter Wave (mmWave) based Vital Sign Monitoring System which can accurately estimate the breathing rate, heart rate and heart rate viability (HRV) for multiple objects. Part of the system has been invited to demo for [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/) and it is being commercialized... 

<b> 5. 5G Massive MIMO for Localization and Tracking </b> [see more](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/publications/5MassiveMIMOLocalization)
  * We developed a massive MIMO based localization and tracking system on the base of [Time Reversal techniques](http://video.cmsworldwide.com/SP17/SP17_RayLiu_Keynote_1080p.mp4), which can **benifit from the unavoidable multipath distortions** in our daily life and thus improves the scalability greatly.

## Time Reversal (TR) for Tracking and Localization
<b> 6. Time Reversal Based Localization and Tracking </b> [see more](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/publications/6TRLocalization)
  * By using the Time Reversal theory, the so called detrimental multipath signal has been turned from enemy to friend for target localization and tracking. We then developed a decimeter-level accuracy localization and tracking algorithm which can work robustly regardless of the environments.

<b> 7. RF-based Indoor Tracking System </b> [see more](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/publications/7RF-Indoor-Tracking)
  * Leveraging the naturally existing multipath signals in rich-scattering indoor scenarios, we developed an active and a passive Indoor Tracking Systems with decimeter-accuracy 
  * The research facilitated three ongoing products including Cart-tracking in supermarkets, Fall-detector and Gait-recognition, which has been partly invited for demo to Apple, HP, Qualcomm, Verizon, Marvell
