We do not need sensors, wearables but <b> only the exisiting WiFi deployment </b> together with our ***AI Techniques, Signal Process methods, radar techniques, 5G communication skills...*** to make your life easier and convenient, <b> by your control of course </b>. Wireless AI for wireless sensing and localization using ambient radio signals

## AI Techniques for Wireless Sensing
<b> 1.  Device-free Wireless Monitoring System </b>
  * We created the first-of-its-kind device-free motion sensing system, which can detect the object motion with only 1 pair of WiFi devices. The system has been commercialized by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/) and won the [CES 2020 Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2020/Honorees/L/Linksys-Aware.aspx). In partnership with [Belkin](https://www.belkin.com/us/), it has been deployed over 150 countries worldwide as [LinkSysAware](https://www.linksys.com/us/linksys-aware/).

<b> 2. Wireless Vital Signs Detection System </b>
  * We developed an accurate Breathing Rate Detection System using CSI extracted from only 1 pair of commercial WiFi devices.
  * The research was then developed as a Sleep Monitoring System and commercialized as Origin Health for Remote Patient Monitoring by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/), which won the [CES 2021 Best of Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2021/Best-Of/O/Origin-Health-Remote-Patient-Monitoring.aspx),


<b> 3. Wireless Driver Arrival Sensing for Smart Car </b>
  * Designed the system by using WiFi-FTM (IEEE 802.11mc, 2016). By enabling driver's arrival time sensing, the car
is more smart in multiple-service management than the existing driver's presence sensing only system.
  * Implemented the system and ported it into Linux OS for real-world validation. Experiments in varieties of parking lots and garages show that it can robustly achieve 92.5% accuracy with less than 1s error
  * 

## Tracking and Localization
<b> 4. mmWave-Based Vital Signs Monitoring </b>
  * Worked on the design and development of a Millimeter Wave (mmWave) based Vital Sign Monitoring System which can accurately estimate the breathing rate, heart rate and heart rate viability for multiple objects
  * The research has been implemented by using off-the-shelf mmWave Radar and part of the system has been invited to demo for Qualcomm. It is being commercialized by Origin Wireless AI Inc. for Non-contact Vital Sign Monitoring.

<b> 5. mmWave and 5G Massive MIMO for Localization and Tracking </b>
  * Developed and implemented the system on the base of Time Reversal and Massive MIMO techniques, which over- comes the unavoidable multipath distortions and thus improving the scalability in different environments
  * Derived and validated the theoretical performance of the system which can achieve up to centimeter-accuracy while enjoys low overhead by leveraging the existing 5G Massive MIMO base stations and multipath signals

<b> 6. Time Reversal Based Localization and Tracking </b>
  * Built the signal model on the base of Time Reversal theory which turns the detrimental multipath signal from enemy to friend for target localization and tracking.
  * Utilized DNN to learn the feature of background perturbations and thus make the system work robustly in both static and dynamic environments regardless of multipath distortions

<b> 7. RF-based Indoor Tracking System </b>
  * Worked on the development and validation of two calibration-free Indoor Tracking Systems with decimeter-accuracy by exploring the statistical properties of the received signals.
  * The research facilitated three ongoing products including Cart-tracking in supermarkets, Fall-detector and Gait-recognition, which has been partly invited for demo to Apple, HP, Qualcomm, Verizon, Marvell
