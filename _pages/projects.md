## AI Techniques for Wireless Sensing
<b> 1.  Device-free Wireless Monitoring System </b> [see more](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/publications/Wireless-Monitor)
  * We created the first-of-its-kind device-free motion sensing system, which can detect the object motion with only 1 pair of WiFi devices. The system has been commercialized by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/) and won the [CES 2020 Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2020/Honorees/L/Linksys-Aware.aspx). In partnership with [Belkin](https://www.belkin.com/us/), it has been deployed over 150 countries worldwide as [LinkSysAware](https://www.linksys.com/us/linksys-aware/).

<b> 2. Wireless Vital Signs Detection System </b> [see more](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/publications/2Wireless-Vital-Sign)
  * We developed an accurate Breathing Rate Detection System using CSI extracted from only 1 pair of commercial WiFi devices. The research was then developed as a Sleep Monitoring System and commercialized as Origin Health for Remote Patient Monitoring by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/), which won the [CES 2021 Best of Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2021/Best-Of/O/Origin-Health-Remote-Patient-Monitoring.aspx).

<b> 3. Wireless Driver Arrival Sensing for Smart Car </b>
  * We designed the system by using WiFi Fine Time Measurements (WiFi-FTM, IEEE 802.11mc, 2016). By enabling driver's arrival time sensing, the car
is more smart in multiple-service management than the existing driver's presence sensing only system. The system has been implemented and ported it into Linux OS for real-world validation in different parking lots and garages in Maryland, which indicates 92.5% accuracy with less than 1s error

## mmWave Localization and Sensing Tracking and Localization
<b> 4. mmWave and 5G Massive MIMO for Localization and Tracking </b>
  * To tackle the unavoidable multipath distortions in our daily life, we developed and implemented a massive MIMO based localization and tracking system on the base of [Time Reversal techniques](http://video.cmsworldwide.com/SP17/SP17_RayLiu_Keynote_1080p.mp4). Mainly, we treat all the LoS and NLoS signal componetns as a whole by exploring the statistical property of the electromagnetic (EM) waves and thus improve the scalability in different environments.

  * 
<b> 5. mmWave-Based Vital Signs Monitoring </b>
  * To extract the weak Vital Sign signals, we designed and developedof a Millimeter Wave (mmWave) based Vital Sign Monitoring System which can accurately estimate the breathing rate, heart rate and heart rate viability for multiple objects. The research has been implemented by using off-the-shelf mmWave Radar and part of the system has been invited to demo for [Qualcomm](https://www.qualcomm.com/). It is being commercialized by Origin Wireless AI Inc. for Non-contact Vital Sign Monitoring.

## Time Reversal (TR) Based Tracking and Localization
<b> 6. Time Reversal Based Localization and Tracking </b>
  * By using the Time Reversal theory, the so called detrimental multipath signal has been turned from enemy to friend for target localization and tracking. We then developed a decimeter-level accuracy localization and tracking algorithm which can work robustly regardless of the environments.

<b> 7. RF-based Indoor Tracking System </b>
  * Leveraging the naturally existing multipath signals in rich-scattering indoor scenarios, we developed an active and a passive Indoor Tracking Systems with decimeter-accuracy 
  * The research facilitated three ongoing products including Cart-tracking in supermarkets, Fall-detector and Gait-recognition, which has been partly invited for demo to Apple, HP, Qualcomm, Verizon, Marvell
