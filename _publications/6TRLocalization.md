## Abstract
<b> 1. What is Time Reversal? </b> <br>
  * Time reversal (TR) is a fundamental physical phenomenon that takes advantage of an unavoidable but rich multipath radio propagation environment to create a spatial-temporal resonance effect, the so-called **focusing effect** (refer to [Why Time Reversal](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/files/WhyTimeReversal.pdf)).
  * Mathematically, the TR effect is simply for the environment to serve as the computer to perform a perfect deconvolution that is, the environment behaves like a matched filter!. 

<b> 2. How to leverage Multipath? </b> <br>
  * As stated, TR takes adavatage of the environment to constructively add all the radio signal components (both LoS and multipath) in a specific location at a specific timestamp (**focusing effect**). We design the transimitting signal as the TR version of the Forward-Echo. As a result, the transmitting signal will focus on the target and thus improving the SNR greatly. In this sense, TR works like a waveguide which navigates the transimitting power to illuminate on the target. As the **focusing effect** is constructed by the massive signal components, the more the multipath components, the better the **focusing effect** will be.

<b> 3. Have you tested your system using practical measurements? </b>
  *  The research was then developed as a Sleep Monitoring System and commercialized as Origin Health for Remote Patient Monitoring by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/), which won the [CES 2021 Best of Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2021/Best-Of/O/Origin-Health-Remote-Patient-Monitoring.aspx). <br>
