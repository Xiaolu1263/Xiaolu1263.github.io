## Abstract
<b> 1. What is Time Reversal? </b> <br>
  * Time reversal (TR) is a fundamental physical phenomenon that takes advantage of an unavoidable but rich multipath radio propagation environment to create a spatial-temporal resonance effect, the so-called focusing effect (refer to [Why Time Reversal](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/files/WhyTimeReversal.pdf)).
  * Mathematically, the TR effect is simply for the environment to serve as the computer to perform a perfect deconvolution that is, the environment behaves like a matched filter!. 

<b> 2. Can CSI really measure chest movement since it is very weak? </b> <br>
  * Mathematically, the TR effect is simply for the environment to serve as the computer to perform a perfect deconvolution that is, the environment behaves like a matched filter!. 

<b> 3. Have you tested your system using practical measurements? </b>
  *  The research was then developed as a Sleep Monitoring System and commercialized as Origin Health for Remote Patient Monitoring by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/), which won the [CES 2021 Best of Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2021/Best-Of/O/Origin-Health-Remote-Patient-Monitoring.aspx). <br>

<b> Key words: Vital Signs, CSI, Sleep Monitoring.</b>
