## Abstract <br>
In a low-angle target parameter estimation scenario, the backscattered signals from targets are often distorted due to clutter and multipath, which significantly degrades the performance of direction-ofarrival(DOA) estimation. In general, the backscattered multipaths are modeled as coherent signals with respect to the direct path. Decorrelation
algorithms such as spatial smoothing and matrix reconstruction can mitigate the effect of multipath. However, most of these methods will perform poorly or even fail for solving parameter estimation problem of low-angle targets in complex terrain where there are rich multipath scatterings. This paper presents a novel method that combines time reversal (TR) technique, coherent signal-subspace method (CSM), and multiple signal classification algorithm to perform DOA estimation in a low-angle target scenario. The TR technique takes advantage of multipath echoes recorded by a sensor array and adaptively adjusts TR probing waveforms to increase the signal-to-noise ratio in a rich scattering environment. Moreover, the CSM method compresses the energy of a signal into a predefined subspace to exploit the full time-bandwidth product of signal sources and cope with coherent wavefronts. As a result, the proposed new DOA estimation algorithm outperforms significantly the conventional methods. The Cramerâ€“Rao bounds analysis and numerical simulations commendably validate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method.
