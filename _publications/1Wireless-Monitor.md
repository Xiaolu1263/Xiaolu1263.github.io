  * The movement of a object embedded in the environment will casue corresponding changes in the [Wireless Channel Station Information (CSI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_state_information). As a result, intuitively, we can extract the object motion from the measured CSI of Wireless Links. Luckily, most of the WiFi devices support/provide CSI out put now such as [Intel 5300](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/wireless-products/ultimate-n-wifi-link-5300-brief.html), [Marvell 88W8897](https://www.marvell.com/content/dam/marvell/en/public-collateral/wireless/marvell-wireless-88w8897-product-brief-2018-10.pdf)...

  * We do not have to. By using [Time Reversal](http://video.cmsworldwide.com/SP17/SP17_RayLiu_Keynote_1080p.mp4) techniques, we can leverage the multipath components by exploring the statistical property of the received electromagnetic (EM) signals. In other words, we treat LoS and NLoS signals as a whole. Thus, multipath is not a problem at all.

  * The research has been commercialized by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/) as [LinkSysAware](https://www.linksys.com/us/linksys-aware/) which won the [CES 2020 Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2020/Honorees/L/Linksys-Aware.aspx). In partnership with [Belkin](https://www.belkin.com/us/), it has been deployed over 150 countries worldwide as [LinkSysAware](https://www.linksys.com/us/linksys-aware/).
