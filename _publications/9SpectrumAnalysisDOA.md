## Abstract
<b> 1. How to take full adavantage of the Sensor Array? </b> <br>
  * We have investegated the subarray optimization methods such as Minimum-Redundancy Linear Array ([MRA](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/files/MRCArray.pdf)), [Nest Array](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/files/NestedArray.pdf)...

<b> 2. Tytical Spectum Analysis Methods? </b> <br>
  * [MUSIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSIC_(algorithm)), [ESPRIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_of_signal_parameters_via_rotational_invariance_techniques), [IAA](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/files/stoica2011IAA.pdf), [Nonuniformly Spectra](https://xiaolu1263.github.io/files/11-NonuniformlySpectra.pdf)

<b> 3. Have you tested your system using practical measurements? </b>
  *  The research was then developed as a Sleep Monitoring System and commercialized as Origin Health for Remote Patient Monitoring by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/), which won the [CES 2021 Best of Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2021/Best-Of/O/Origin-Health-Remote-Patient-Monitoring.aspx). <br>

<b> Key words: Vital Signs, CSI, Sleep Monitoring.</b>
