## Abstract
<b> 1. What challenges are there for High-accuracy Localization and Tracking? </b> <br>
  * One of the biggest problem is multipath distortions which is a ill-posted problem for many years. 
  * Another problem is the resolution/compacity ability which means how many clients you can serve simultaneously.

<b> 2. How do you solve the Multipath issue? </b> <br>
  * Different from most of the localization methods which need to distinguish LoS and NLoS signal components, we treat LoS and NLoS signal as a whole and explore the statistical property of the received signal. We prove that the strength of the autocorrelation function (ACFS)of the received signal in massive MIMO systems exhibits like a stable Sinclike focusing beam around the receiver in spatial domain. By using ACFS, we bypass the problem that the ***LOS and NLOS signals are hard to be distinguished*** in severe NLOS environments.

<b> 3. Have you tested your system using practical measurements? </b>
  *  The research was then developed as a Sleep Monitoring System and commercialized as Origin Health for Remote Patient Monitoring by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/), which won the [CES 2021 Best of Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2021/Best-Of/O/Origin-Health-Remote-Patient-Monitoring.aspx). <br>

<b> Key words: Vital Signs, CSI, Sleep Monitoring.</b>
