## Abstract <br>
Transmit/Receive (T/R) module is a key part of Active phased array radar (APAR). It is necessary to test (T/R) the module strictly before it is set up into the radar system,
which is called Off-Line Test. An APAR system is generally composed of thousands of T/R modules, which results in the heavy test task. For the difficulties of heavy test task and
complex operations, a T/R module automatic test system is introduced in this paper, including the design of the hardware platform and software system, especially the data processing
and the timing control design. The system is applied successfully at present and shortens the test time to 0.5 hour from the traditional 20 hours for a Ku-band T/R module with
16 channels. It is characterized by high test efficiency, accurate measurement results and easy operation, hence solving the difficulties of T/R module test effectively.
