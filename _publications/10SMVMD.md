## Abstract
<b> 1. What challenges are there for High-accuracy Localization and Tracking? </b> <br>
  * One of the biggest problem is multipath distortions which is a ill-posted problem for many years. Another problem is the resolution/compacity ability which means how many clients you can serve simultaneously

<b> 2. Can CSI really measure chest movement since it is very weak? </b> <br>
  * Yes the CSI changes caused by breathing rate is very weak. However, we have multiple subcarriers for both [2.4GHz & 5GHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels) with whatever bandwidth ([usually, 20MHz, 40MHz, 80MHz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WLAN_channels)). As a result, we design a subcarrier selection method and futher using a [maximum-ratio combining (MRC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal-ratio_combining#:~:text=In%20telecommunications%2C%20maximum%2Dratio%20combining,noise%20level%20in%20that%20channel.) to boost the vital signs. 

<b> 3. Have you tested your system using practical measurements? </b>
  *  The research was then developed as a Sleep Monitoring System and commercialized as Origin Health for Remote Patient Monitoring by [Origin Wireless AI Inc.](https://www.originwirelessai.com/), which won the [CES 2021 Best of Innovation Award](https://www.ces.tech/Innovation-Awards/Honorees/2021/Best-Of/O/Origin-Health-Remote-Patient-Monitoring.aspx). <br>

<b> Key words: Vital Signs, CSI, Sleep Monitoring.</b>
